	Navigating the diagram <br />To move around on the diagram either:
	<ul>
		<li>Drag the diagram with your cursor, or
		<li>Place your cursor over the diagram and use the keyboard arrow
			keys, or
		<li>Use the arrows in the controller in the top left corner of
			the diagram
	</ul>
	To zoom in or out place the cursor over the diagram and press the plus
	(+) or minus (-) key on your keyboard. Alternatively, select the zoom
	level by clicking the appropriate bar in the zoom level indicator in
	the controller in the top left corner of the diagram.<br />
	<b>Query term auto-completion</b><br />The search box above has an
	auto-complete feature which lists terms (names and identifiers)
	matching the query you`ve typed in. However, it required you to type in
	at least 2 characters. By default it lists only the terms beginning
	with the string specified. If you want to relax this restriction, i.e.
	have the auto-complete to suggests terms containing the specified
	string anywhere in the term, prepend * to your query string.<br />
	<b>Searching</b><br />Search is performed over reaction and pathway
	names and over entity names, identifiers and GO molecular function
	terms (name, accession and EC number)<br />The search is initially
	performed with the requirement for exact match to the query term. If
	nothing is found, the matching criteria are relaxed and the search is
	performed again with the requirement for all the words in the query to
	match (but not necessarily in the given order). If still nothing is
	found, the criteria are relaxed even further allowing the query term to
	be a fragment of a word.<br />Please note that the matches as reported
	in the <b>Search results</b> tab do not necessarily have to have the
	query term in their display name. For example, a search for <b>Adenosine
		5`-triphosphate</b> results in a list of entities with display name <b>ATP</b>.
	All occurrences of ATP as well as of complexes and sets containing ATP
	are highlighted on the map.
